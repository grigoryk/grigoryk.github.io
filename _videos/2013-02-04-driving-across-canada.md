A few years ago, I lived in Ontario. In February of 2013 I went for a rather long drive with my dad - from Mississauga, ON, to Victoria, BC. A winter roadtrip is one hell of a way to move to British Columbia.

Shot with a GoPro mounted on the dashboard and taking a photo every 10 seconds. Some odd 44,000+ photos where then combined into video chunks using ffmpeg, and edited with iMovie.

Music:

- K.C. Accidental - Residential Love Song
- Yppah - Never mess with Sunday
- Caribou - Sun
- Smile - Jean Michel
