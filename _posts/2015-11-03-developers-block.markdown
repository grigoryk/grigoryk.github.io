For the past several years I've been going through what I'm going to call here a "developer's block". It's very much like a writer's block, in that as time passes I'm finding it increasingly harder to create anything outside of my work. This post is a way to document some back story, attempt an analysis of sorts and plan out a way out of this hole that I've manage to dig for myself.

## Some backstory
I've been making all sorts of various things since around grade 8. I won't list particular projects - they don't matter. What matters is that I've been actively writing code and putting it out there for people to use for about 12 years now. And then at some point I have stopped. It seems that, tracing back my progress - or rather, regress - I've slowed down work on personal projects and ideas sometime around finishing university and starting my first post-graduation (I did three of internships and bunch of freelance dev work throughout school) job at a startup in Kitchener. I didn't stop completely and suddenly, but instead everything just sort of tapered off. It became hard to start things, and even harder to finish them. I used to have an active blog (in Russian), which has been entirely abandoned. I can't even really remember for sure the last thing that I've made and published, other than [helping setup custom map hosting](http://www.grigory.ca/2014/07/hosting-maps-fast-and-cheap/) for my partner. That's not to say that I haven't coded anything at all outside of work in those years - there were a few little projects here and there, but even "internal use" tools just for myself have stopped coming off my keyboard, last one being a [personal diet tracking tool](https://github.com/grigoryk/eatright).

## Why is this a problem?
Partly because it certainly feels like one. I have this constant, nagging feeling that I should be creating something. I'm used to creating stuff. Whenever I think back to what I've used a computer for, there was almost always a project, some users, some feedback, some writing. I love that stuff... at least I definitely used to. So now it just feels like a strange void. I have generally filled it with what people might generally refer to as "life", but the nagging feeling and lack of satisfaction is there.

Additionally, one of my ambitions is complete financial independence and making the world if only a little better, and for some reason I have this silly thought in my head that I should be able to accomplish both by creating truly useful, thoughtful things. It seems obvious that inability to maintain and push forward "side-projects" is quite detrimental.

## Work
When you write code for a living and push out products into production, spending 8-9 hours daily at the office - well, it'd be foolish to ignore that as a factor. However, I'm not convinced that work itself is the problem. Perhaps it was what stopped me from working on personal projects when I've spent almost a year trying to get a company off the ground. When you're in that "founder" mindset and on a short timeline, it's hard to justify working on something other than your product. But generally speaking, work has made me a better developer, exposed me to new tech, gave me certain personal freedoms (at the expense of time). Over the years I got a little better at mentally compartmentalizing work - it's hard, but certainly possible and seems to be absolutely crucial.

So work by itself isn't necessarily the problem. But it could be a trigger. In no particular order:

### Burnout & mental health
I've experienced what seemed like a burnout, but in retrospect was more of a depression. It seems like a good idea to dedicate another blog post to the topic in order to do it justice. I'll just mention that after experiencing a complete breakdown of my professional life at the time, I'm acutely aware of dangers of spending most of your time working on the wrong things, and not seeing and dealing with mental problems in a sustainable way. Thankfully after a lot of retrospection I have more or less figured out what caused my problems, and how not to place myself into similar situations.

However, as I was dealing with those issues, I'm afraid that I've created mental blocks around certain activities and patterns, and created negative associations with "work outside of work". I'm realizing now that they are not entirely necessary, and everything could be just fine in moderation.

### Time
Recently I've spent a brainstorming session trying to, once again, figure out - what is it that I actually want to do? I'm closing in on my third decade, and I still haven't really figured it out (the third decade bit didn't factor in at the time, but perhaps it should have). And I don't mean some entirely absorbing passion, or a grand life plan, or anything along those line. I'd be happy with a general, coherent direction and perhaps some goals.

It seems that I'm currently following something along these lines: "work, get paid, try to lead a good life, be healthy, build meaningful relationships, and explore my inner self and the world around". So, that's something, if just a little vague.

During my brainstorming session I kept coming back to the fact that I need time, more time - to read, to think, to construct and develop ideas, to talk with people. The most precious resource I seem to miss is time. This way of thinking makes deciding what to work on even harder - if I'm telling myself that I dearly need more time, I can't just squander it on learning some new JavaScript library and building a little project with it. I could be instead reading up on some philosophical ideas that have been bothering me lately, or perhaps trying to brainstorm my way out of yet another mental dead end. That is, of course, unless I can justify learning and building techy stuff and work it into the bigger picture (whatever *that* might be). It's all about my perception, after all.

I did take a very concrete step, however. I've talk to good people at my work, and we have agreed that I will be taking every other Friday off. So, every other weekend is a three day weekend, and sometimes they even turn into four day weekend, thanks to statutory holidays. This has been fairly recent so too early to report on long-term effects, but I feel it's a great step in the right direction. This directly gives me more free time in continuous blocks, and has a lot of other positive effects that are harder to quantify.

## Pattern of consumption
Reddit, HackerNews. HN, reddit. Rinse and repeat. The fact that content is often interesting and sometimes even thought-provoking only seems to postpone realization that its constant consumption is not actually any good for me. I feel that over the years I have shifted my behavior online from active participation in select few communities, to passive consumption of many communities. It's been a gradual shift, but at this point in time it got to the point that if I want to visit something other than reddit or HN, other than CBC/BBC nothing really comes to mind. I'm not even exaggerating this too much.

What this did, over time, is created a paradigm shift. It changed the baseline from "participate, contribute and get feedback" to "read, hopefully learn (but most likely just forget), rarely participate". I feel that this must trickle down into other parts of my life, it has to. It just seems like a general behavioral pattern.

To combat this, I feel that cutting down the amount of time spent consuming content is important. Perhaps creation will start to fill the newly produced void.

## Tinkering
I used to tinker with my computer all the time. When I was a kid, I treated its physical body as a malleable LEGO set. I was lucky enough to have been raised by parents who provided me with enough parts to assemble, re-assemble, and sometimes modify them to make things fit. Later on I started running linux full time, and tinkered endlessly with it - oftentimes just to get some basics working. I've learned a lot, did a bunch of cool stuff with it. Then I switched to OSX. At first, it was a bit of a relief - finally, things "just work". But it feels that over the years I've been using it (around 6-7 years now, I'm onto my second personal macbook and there were a few work-provided macbooks), I've lost that passion for tinkering with my own computer. There wasn't much need. Yes, things generally work. Perhaps it made me more productive? It's hard to quantify. But I keep asking myself - at what cost? What did I loose - or rather, not gain - in those years?

An obvious thing to do here is to switch away from OSX. About a year ago I've installed Arch on my MBAir, but never really followed through with it. I remember there was some annoyance, and some things just seemed needlessly complicated. In the end, I didn't have patience for it - and went hiking instead. It seems that spending time screwing around with linux distros isn't the best use of my time - but then again, perhaps it's part of a some longer-term plan that actually makes sense.

## Building things "offline"
Recently I've signed up for a membership at a local maker place - [http://www.makerlabs.com](MakerLabs). They give you access to a whole bunch of tools - a woodworking shop, laser cutters, CNC routers, 3D Printers, etc. My goal is to learn some new skills, and build some very tangible things. I've started with a maple cutting board, which was simple and fun. I've met interesting people from different fields in there, and perhaps that will lead to some cross-polination of ideas.
