  <h1>Hello,</h1>
  <p>I'm software developer and a startup guy based in Vancouver, BC. I love building Internet things and launching products. <a href="mailto: grigory.kruglov@gmail.com">Email me</a> if you'd like to meet up for a coffee, I really enjoy meeting local entrepreneurs, developers, and just about anyone interesting.</p>

  <p>This website is just in a process of resurrection after couple of years of sitting on a shelf.</p>

  <ul class="posts">
    {% for post in site.posts %}
      <li>
        <span class="post-date">{{ post.date | date: "%b %-d, %Y" }}</span>
        <a class="post-link" href="{{ post.url | prepend: site.baseurl }}">{{ post.title }}</a>
      </li>
    {% endfor %}
  </ul>
</div>
