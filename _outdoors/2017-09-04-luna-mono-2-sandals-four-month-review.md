I bought these sandals on May 5th, 2017. This review is written on September 4th, 2017.

**Usage**
I've been wearing these sandals every every day. On an average week that includes cycling or walking (~4km) to work, walking around the city, walking in the office to get coffee, and hiking on the weekends. I run in Lunas as well, but I don't run often - perhaps a couple of times a month, for about 5-10km. I did some multi-day backpacking trips in these sandals as well. The single worst thing I've done in them is probably foot breaking on a longboard - but only once, since the tread wears out very heavily.

I guess most of the "wear and tear" happens during my hikes. A typical hike would include a day pack and 5-8 hours of walking up and down coastal mountains near Vancouver.

**Impressions**
Overall, I love these sandals. They are by far the most comfortable footwear I've had the pleasure of wearing. That goes for all of the uses I've put them through, but they're especially great while hiking. The treat is quite sticky, and I've never felt that they weren't enough of a shoe in any of my hikes. However, on my backpacking trips, after a few long days of walking through mountains with an overnight pack, I would overuse my ankles. Currently I'm chalking this up to "my feet aren't strong enough". Normally I would go on multi-day trips in my regular Merrel Moab hiking boots, and so this is new territory for me.

Lunas came with "tech straps", which you can attach around your ankles for added support. I personally don't find them very useful, and almost never wear them. Sandals work just as well without these straps on my feet.

These sandals get a lot of attention on the trails. I'm used to people looking at my feet while hiking, since I'd be either wearing my Fivefingers or going barefoot, and Lunas are no different.

They were *not* very comfortable at the start - specifically the front strap did irritate me for a couple of weeks. Also, for my taste they're a tad too thick. However, now that they've worn down quite a bit, I find them nicer to walk in.

**Wear and tear**
This brings me to "wear". Frankly, I'm disappointed. I've only had these Lunas for four months, and looking at their tread I don't think they will last another summer. It's a tricky design constraint - the soles need to be soft enough to be comfortable and offer a "minimalist" feel, but they also must be durable. It's hard to say if Luna did a good job combining these two requirements - or rather, if these Vibram soles were the right choice. Other than "tread", there's not much to these sandals. The "top layer" started to peel off a bit (see photos below). The straps and the buckles are as good as new and feel pretty bulletproof.

**Summary**
Very comfortable sandals, I love the idea of them, but given their current condition I'm projecting that they're going to be a poor value at ~$120CAD. Given my usage, I anticipate retiring them sometime in spring or early summer of 2018, which is about a year after purchasing (I'm not planning to wear them on the cold rainy winter days). In the meantime, I'm going to look into building similar sandals myself.

In comparison, my 7 or 8 year old hiking fivefingers are still going strong, and I bought them for about the same price.

Here is what my Monos look like after four months of daily wear:

As you can see, the tread is not doing well. Extra wear on the left sandal is from a single longboard ride, stopping a couple of times via a "foot brake". Little holes are from aggressive, spiky pedals on my mountain bike.

For reference, here is what Luna Mono 2.0 sandals look like when they are brand new (random internet image):
