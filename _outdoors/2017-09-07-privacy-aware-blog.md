description: I've removed anything that might track readers of this blog
---
I just removed Google Analytics and Disqus comments from this website. I'm hoping to replace both with self-hosted solutions. Currently, there is *no* analytics. And if you'd like to comment, just email me.

There were some comments, but not many, and not a lot of traffic. The entertainment value I get from looking at visitor charts is pretty high, but not high enough to willingly subject visitors to being tracked.

This website is hosted on Github Pages. Honestly, I'm not sure what *they* do with server logs. Since this is a tiny static blog on my own domain, I'm going to move it to a tiny DigitalOcean droplet.

I hope to write more on the subject in the future.
