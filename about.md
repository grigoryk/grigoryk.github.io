Привет!

My name is Grisha. I was born in the USSR, grew up in Tashkent (Uzbekistan), and got a chance to live in Russia for a few years. I now live in the beautiful Vancouver, Canada.

I spend most of my time working on Firefox, mostly on its <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.mozilla.firefox">Android version</a> and <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/features/sync/">Firefox Sync</a>. It's a constantly humbling experience - building software at scale is hard, and I'm learning a lot about the craft, and about myself.
