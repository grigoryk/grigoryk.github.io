Привет!

My name is Grisha. I was born in the USSR, grew up in Tashkent, Uzbekistan and got a chance to live in Russia for a few years. For nearly two decades Canada has been my home. Very lucky to live in the beautiful city of Vancouver.

Currently I work at Microsoft, building software that lets others create <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/communication-services/">"communication experiences"</a>.<br>I used spend most of my time working on Firefox, mostly on its <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.mozilla.firefox">Android version</a>, <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/features/sync/">Firefox Sync</a> <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/mentat/">and</a> <a href="https://github.com/mozilla-mobile/android-components/">other</a> <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/application-services/">stuff</a>. Building software at scale and with others is hard, so work remains a constantly humbling experience for me. I'm learning a lot about the craft, the world and myself.
